# Modern CLI Layout Patterns and Information Architecture Research

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive research examines modern CLI layout patterns and information architecture approaches, focusing on component-based layouts, responsive terminal systems, and advanced UI libraries like Rich, Textual, and Blessed. The findings reveal a significant shift toward declarative, web-inspired approaches for terminal UI design in 2024.

## 1. Component-Based Layout Patterns

### 1.1 Rich Library Layout System

**Key Architecture:**
- Dynamically divides terminal screen into configurable sections
- Supports nested, flexible layouts with multiple configuration options
- Uses `split_column()` and `split_row()` methods for complex screen divisions

**Configuration Options:**
- **Size Control**: Fixed size (exact rows/characters), flexible ratio-based sizing, minimum size constraints
- **Visibility**: Toggle layout sections on/off, dynamic show/hide components
- **Rendering**: Embed any Rich renderable (panels, text, etc.), automatic content sizing

**Example Implementation:**
```python
layout = Layout()
layout.split_column(
    Layout(name="upper"),
    Layout(name="lower")
)
layout["lower"].split_row(
    Layout(name="left"),
    Layout(name="right")
)
```

**Advanced Techniques:**
- Set specific ratios for layout sections
- Programmatically update layout content
- Visualize layout structure using `.tree` attribute

### 1.2 Textual Framework Architecture

**Declarative Design Principles:**
- Uses CSS-like TCSS (Textual Cascading Style Sheets) for styling
- Layouts defined declaratively without manual size calculations
- Widgets automatically adjust to terminal/screen resizing

**Component Structure:**
- Composed of widgets and containers
- Core widgets: Header, Footer, Input, Markdown display, Vertical scrolling containers
- Event-driven architecture with `on_mount()` and `@on(Input.Submitted)`
- Concurrency handling with `@work` decorator

**Layout Management:**
- Docking widgets using `dock` CSS rule to fix widgets to screen edges
- Flexible space with FR units (`1fr`) for equal space division
- Built-in containers like `HorizontalScroll` and `VerticalScroll`

## 2. Responsive Terminal Layout Systems

### 2.1 Terminal Size Detection and Adaptation

**Modern CLI Principles (2024):**
- Context-aware CLIs pick up meaningful information about terminal environment
- "Responsive is more important than fast" - immediate feedback is crucial
- Designed for humans first, moving away from traditional UNIX assumptions

**Adaptation Strategies:**
- Dynamic adjustment to terminal dimensions
- Context-aware rendering based on terminal capabilities
- Progressive enhancement from basic to advanced features
- Performance-first approach with immediate feedback

**Terminal Advantages:**
- Fast and responsive with no animations or superfluous visual baggage
- Negligible startup/loading time
- Instantaneous screen transitions
- Limited but uniform interface elements

### 2.2 Blessed Library Capabilities

**Screen Management:**
- Up-to-the-moment location and terminal height/width detection
- Context managers like `Terminal.fullscreen()` for safe terminal mode management
- Precise cursor positioning with `term.location(x, y)`
- Current cursor location detection via `Terminal.get_location()`

**Positioning Features:**
- Terminal-aware text wrapping and centering methods
- Printable length calculation for strings with terminal sequences
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, Mac, Linux, BSD)

## 3. Split Panes and Window Management

### 3.1 PyMux - Python Terminal Multiplexer

**Architecture:**
- Terminal multiplexer written entirely in Python
- tmux-compatible shortcuts and commands
- No C extensions required, Python 2.6-3.5 compatibility

**Features:**
- Completion menu for command line with fish-style suggestions
- Both Emacs and Vi key bindings support
- Individual titlebars for each pane
- Multi-client support with independent window viewing

**Current Status (2024):**
- Requires maintenance for modern prompt_toolkit compatibility
- prompt-toolkit-3.0 branch available for latest version compatibility

### 3.2 Traditional tmux Integration

**Basic Commands:**
- Ctrl+b " — split pane horizontally
- Ctrl+b % — split pane vertically
- Ctrl+b arrow key — switch pane
- Hold Ctrl+b and arrow keys — resize pane

## 4. Tree Views and Hierarchical Displays

### 4.1 Rich Tree Implementation

**Core Capabilities:**
- Tree class for generating terminal tree views
- Great for filesystem contents or hierarchical data
- Branch labels support text or any Rich renderable
- `add()` method returns new Tree instance for building complex trees

### 4.2 Modern Alternatives and Patterns

**Alternative Approaches:**
- Miller Columns view for subnodes display
- Hybrid approaches combining list view, breadcrumb, and tree view
- Tree testing for information architecture evaluation

**2024 Trends:**
- Moving away from traditional tree navigation
- Emphasis on human-centered design
- Consideration of alternatives for complex hierarchies

## 5. Table Formatting and Alignment

### 5.1 Library Comparison

**Tabulate (Recommended for Performance):**

- Superior performance for large datasets
- Support for different alignments per column

**PrettyTable (Recommended for Features):**
- Extensive customization options
- Text alignment (left, right, center)
- Column sorting capabilities
- Built-in styles (DEFAULT, PLAIN_COLUMNS, MSWORD_FRIENDLY, MARKDOWN)

**Rich Tables:**

- Works well with pandas DataFrames via rich-dataframe module

### 5.2 2024 Performance Insights

**Community Recommendations:**
- **beautifultable**: Best maintained with good API and colored support

## 7. Modal Dialogs and Overlay Systems

### 7.1 Textual Modal Implementation

**ModalScreen Pattern:**
```python
class QuitScreen(ModalScreen):
    def compose(self) -> ComposeResult:
        yield Grid(
            Label("Are you sure you want to quit?", id="question"),
            Button("Quit", variant="error", id="quit"),
            Button("Cancel", variant="primary", id="cancel"),
            id="dialog"
        )
```

**Key Features:**
