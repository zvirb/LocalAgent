## Test Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Fix Critical Failures (Week 1)
```bash
# Priority fixes for existing tests
1. Fix async/await issues in base provider tests
2. Correct Ollama provider mock data format
3. Add missing test setup methods  
4. Resolve health check response format issues
5. Update streaming completion test expectations
```

### Phase 2: High-Impact Coverage (Weeks 2-3)
```python
# Focus on modules with business-critical functionality
Priority order:
1. CLI module (user-facing functionality)
2. LLM providers (core business logic)
3. Security module (critical for production)
4. Orchestration (workflow engine)
```

### Phase 3: Comprehensive Coverage (Weeks 4-6)
```python
# Complete testing infrastructure
1. Performance testing suite
2. Integration testing expansion
3. End-to-end user workflow tests
4. Load and stress testing
5. Contract testing for external APIs
```

## Test Quality Framework

### 1. Test Categories Implementation
```python
# Test markers for organization:
@pytest.mark.unit
@pytest.mark.integration  
@pytest.mark.security
@pytest.mark.performance
@pytest.mark.e2e
@pytest.mark.slow
@pytest.mark.external
```

### 2. Mock Strategy Standards
```python
# Standardized mocking approach:
1. Use MockProvider for LLM provider testing
2. Mock external HTTP calls with aioresponses
3. Mock database connections with pytest fixtures
4. Create reusable mock factories for common scenarios
```

### 3. Test Data Management
```python
# Centralized test data:
- tests/fixtures/provider_responses.json
- tests/fixtures/user_scenarios.json
- tests/fixtures/error_responses.json
- tests/fixtures/performance_baselines.json
```

## Automated Testing Pipeline

### 1. Pre-commit Hooks
```yaml
# .pre-commit-config.yaml additions:
- repo: local
  hooks:
    - id: pytest-unit
      name: Run unit tests
      entry: pytest tests/unit/ -x
      language: system
      pass_filenames: false
      
    - id: coverage-check
      name: Check coverage
      entry: pytest --cov=app --cov-fail-under=80
      language: system
      pass_filenames: false
```
