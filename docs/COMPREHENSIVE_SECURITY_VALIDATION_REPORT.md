  - Built-in protection against SQL injection, XSS, and command injection
  - Path traversal protection with dangerous pattern detection
  - Comprehensive sanitization functions
  - Audit logging integration
  - Statistics tracking for security metrics

#### 2. Secure File Operations (Atomic Operations)
- **Location**: `app/cli/io/atomic.py`
- **Strengths**:
  - Write-then-rename atomic operations prevent corruption
  - Proper temporary file permissions (600)
  - Integrity checking with SHA256 checksums
  - Comprehensive error recovery mechanisms
  - Secure cleanup of sensitive data
  - Progress tracking with Rich UI

#### 3. Robust Keyring Integration
- **Location**: `app/security/key_manager.py`
- **Strengths**:
  - OS keyring integration for secure API key storage
  - AES-256-GCM encryption with PBKDF2 key derivation
  - Input validation for provider names and API keys
  - Comprehensive audit logging for all operations
  - Memory cleanup mechanisms
  - Health check functionality

#### 4. Secure Configuration Management
- **Location**: `app/cli/security/secure_config_manager.py`
- **Strengths**:
  - Encrypted configuration storage
  - Proper file permissions (0600/0700)
  - Integration with secure key manager
  - Input validation and sanitization
  - Migration support for legacy configurations
  - Health monitoring and validation

#### 5. Path Traversal Protection
- **Testing Results**: ✅ ALL BLOCKED
  - `../../../etc/passwd` → BLOCKED
  - `..\..\windows\system32` → BLOCKED  
  - `~/../.ssh/id_rsa` → BLOCKED
- **Implementation**: Comprehensive dangerous pattern detection in input validation

#### 6. Temporary File Security
- **Testing Results**: ✅ SECURE
- **File Permissions**: 600 (owner read/write only)
- **Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup on completion/error

### ⚠️ MINOR RECOMMENDATIONS

#### 1. Dependency Security
- **Finding**: Some development dependencies in `.venv` contain test credentials
- **Impact**: LOW (development only)
- **Recommendation**: Regular dependency security scanning

#### 2. Environment Variable Exposure
- **Finding**: 2 potentially sensitive system environment variables detected
- **Impact**: LOW (SSH_AUTH_SOCK, XAUTHORITY are system variables)
- **Recommendation**: Implement environment variable filtering

#### 3. Error Message Information Disclosure
- **Finding**: Some error messages may reveal internal paths
- **Impact**: LOW
- **Recommendation**: Generic error messages for production
