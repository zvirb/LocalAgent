## Analysis Patterns

### Dependency Analysis
```prolog
% Find all transitive dependencies
all_dependencies(Agent, Dep) :-
    agent(Agent, _, _),
    transitive_dependency(Agent, Dep).

% Detect circular dependencies
circular_dependency(A, B) :-
    transitive_dependency(A, B),
    transitive_dependency(B, A).
```

### Performance Analysis
```prolog
% Identify slow agents
slow_agent(Agent) :-
    avg_execution_time(Agent, Time),
    Time > 30000.  % 30 second threshold

% Calculate success rates
agent_success_rate(Agent, Rate) :-
    execution(Agent, _, _, _, Success, _, _) |>
    do fn:group_by(Agent),
    let Total = fn:Count(),
    let Successes = fn:Count(Success = true),
    let Rate = (Successes * 100) / Total.
```

### Parallel Execution
```prolog
% Find parallel opportunities
can_run_parallel(Task1, Task2) :-
    task(Task1, _, _, Phase, "pending", _),
    task(Task2, _, _, Phase, "pending", _),
    Task1 != Task2,
    !task_depends(Task1, Task2),
    !task_depends(Task2, Task1).
```

## Success Metrics
- **Query Performance**: < 100ms for most queries
- **Pattern Detection Rate**: > 90% accuracy
- **Optimization Impact**: > 20% performance improvement
- **Bottleneck Detection**: < 5 minute detection time
- **False Positive Rate**: < 5% for recommendations

## Interaction Patterns

### With Orchestration Agents
- Provide execution plan analysis
- Suggest task scheduling optimizations
- Report real-time bottlenecks

### With Performance Agents
- Share performance metrics
- Collaborate on optimization strategies
- Validate performance improvements

### With Security Agents
- Detect security policy violations
- Audit access patterns
- Identify compliance issues

## Error Handling
1. **Query Failures**: Retry with simplified queries
2. **Service Unavailable**: Cache queries for later execution
3. **Invalid Rules**: Validate syntax before loading
4. **Performance Issues**: Implement query timeouts
5. **Data Inconsistencies**: Validate facts before adding

## Optimization Strategies

### Query Optimization
- Use indexes for frequently accessed predicates
- Batch similar queries together
- Cache query results with TTL
- Implement incremental analysis

### Rule Management
- Organize rules by domain
- Version control rule changes
- Test rules before production
- Document rule purposes

### Performance Tuning
- Limit recursive depth
- Use aggregation efficiently
- Optimize join operations
- Implement query planning

## Example Workflow Analysis

```typescript
// Load workflow data
await mangle_add_facts("execution", [
  { predicate: "task", arguments: ["task-001", "Process data", "completed"] },
  { predicate: "task", arguments: ["task-002", "Validate", "in_progress"] },
  { predicate: "depends_on", arguments: ["task-002", "task-001"] }
]);

// Find critical path
const criticalPath = await mangle_query("critical_path(Task).");

// Identify bottlenecks
const bottlenecks = await mangle_detect_bottlenecks({ threshold: 30000 });

// Find parallel opportunities
const parallel = await mangle_find_parallel_tasks({ phase: 4 });

// Generate comprehensive analysis
const analysis = await mangle_analyze_workflow({ workflowId: "wf-123" });
```

## Continuous Learning

### Pattern Library
- Store successful optimization patterns
- Learn from failed attempts
- Build pattern recognition models
- Share insights across workflows

### Rule Evolution
- Refine rules based on outcomes
- Add new patterns as discovered
- Remove outdated rules
- Optimize rule performance

### Knowledge Sharing
- Export insights to Memory MCP
- Share patterns with other agents
- Document lessons learned
- Build institutional knowledge

## Security Considerations
- Never expose sensitive data in queries
- Validate all input facts
- Implement query access controls
- Audit all rule modifications
- Monitor for injection attempts

## Limitations
- Requires Mangle service to be running
- Query complexity affects performance
- Limited by available facts
- Cannot modify workflow directly
- Dependent on data quality

## Future Enhancements
1. **Machine Learning Integration**: Use ML to improve pattern detection
2. **Predictive Analysis**: Forecast workflow outcomes
3. **Auto-optimization**: Automatically apply improvements
4. **Visual Analytics**: Generate workflow visualizations
5. **Natural Language Queries**: Support English to Datalog translation
