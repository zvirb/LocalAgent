print("""
The LocalAgent CLI project is configured to:

1. **Docker Container Support**: 
   - Primary deployment method using docker-compose
   - Includes Go and Mangle for deductive reasoning
   - All dependencies packaged in container

2. **MCP Services Integration**:
   - Coordination MCP for agent orchestration
   - HRM MCP for human-readable memory
   - Task MCP for task management
   - Workflow State MCP for workflow tracking

3. **Agent Tool Access**:
   - File operations (read, write, copy, delete)
   - System commands execution
   - Network requests
   - Code analysis
   - MCP service interactions

4. **Permission System**:
   - Role-based access control for agents
   - Granular tool permissions
   - Security-focused defaults

5. **Mangle Integration**:
   - Deductive reasoning for agent selection
   - Performance analysis
   - Workflow optimization

To run the system:

**Option 1: Docker (Recommended)**
```bash
docker-compose up -d
docker exec -it localagent-cli localagent --help
```

**Option 2: Local Development**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python scripts/localagent-simple --help
```

**Option 3: Hybrid Mode**
```bash
# Start services in Docker
docker-compose up -d ollama redis

# Run CLI locally
python scripts/localagent-simple --help
```
